## {{< fa kitchen-set >}} Procedure

### 1. Make curry paste:

Put all the curry paste ingredients and two tablespoons each of rapeseed oil and water in a small blender and blitz to a smooth paste.

### 2. Make the ramen broth:

Next, make the ramen broth. Put three tablespoons of rapeseed oil in a large saucepan on a medium heat and, once hot, add the spice paste and fry, stirring regularly, for 10 minutes.
Stir in two teaspoons of the sugar and cook for a further two minutes. Transfer a tablespoon and a half of the mix to a bowl and put to one side.
Stir the peanut butter into the pan, then add the coconut milk, lime zest and a litre of water. Bring up to a simmer, then cook on a low heat for 10 minutes.

### 3. Make the noodles & tempeh:

Meanwhile, make the noodles and tempeh. Cook the noodles according to the packet instructions, then drain in a colander, rinse under cold water and drain again.
Add a little oil to the colander, toss to coat the noodles so they don’t stick, then set aside.
To cook the tempeh, put two tablespoons of rapeseed oil in a nonstick frying pan on a medium heat and, when hot, add the tempeh mince and fry, stirring often, for five minutes, until crisp and browning.
Add the reserved curry paste mix, the remaining teaspoon of sugar and the extra half-teaspoon of salt, fry, stirring, for another three or four minutes, then take off the heat.

### 4. Serve the ramen:

To serve, divide the ramen broth between four bowls, then divide the noodles between the bowls.
Top with the shredded pak choy, crumbled tempeh and coriander, squeeze the juice of a quarter of a lime over each portion and serve with another lime wedge on the side of each bowl.
